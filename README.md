# Death Location

**Death Location** is a mod designed to locate the character's body after death.  
The mod generates a marker that indicates the exact location of the body and shows the distance in meters from the player's current position.  
Once all items are collected, the marker disappears automatically to keep the user interface clean and distraction-free.  

Additionally, it includes a set of **random humorous messages** that creatively describe the circumstances of the character's death.  

## Available Languages
- Spanish  
- English
